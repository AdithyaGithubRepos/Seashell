# Seashell
A simple language which is a bridge between an interpreter and a compiler. it can compile to python, lua, C, and more. (can also compile to an executable!)

# How to build this project?
1. Open project directory in terminal. Make sure you have cmake and mingw installed.
2. type :
mkdir build (make build directory)

## cmake -S . -B build/
## cmake --build build/

side note:  Don't worry beginners! It's not that complicated as it seems. Just copy paste the commands above IN THE PROJECT DIRECTORY and you're done!
            If you're still scared, just wait for an official release for the binaries.
